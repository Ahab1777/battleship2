#Battleship game for The Odin Project

- This is my second attempt at the Battleship exercise for The Odin Project, since the first one had a smelly code I decided to redo it from scratch.

- The main improvement is within the utils.js file, which provides some neat functions to force any coordinate provided, be it array or string, to be automatically converted;

- I also refactored the domManager logic so that it would need less handlers;
